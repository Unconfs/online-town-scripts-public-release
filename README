Look at the fabfile for what tasks can be run with fab.

Additionally, there's a script parallel_fab.sh that is invoked in the following
way:

ONLINETOWN_SERVERS=server1.example.org,server2.example.org ./parallel_fab.sh
example-fab-task

It will output stdout and stderr from all the hosts to ./log/
